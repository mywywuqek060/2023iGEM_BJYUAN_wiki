    <h2>Describe what your results mean</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an important part of your project that the judges will look for.</li>
      <li>Show data, but remember <b>all measurement and characterization data must also be on the Part's Main Page on the <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page">Registry</a>.</b> Otherwise these data will not be in consideration for any medals or part awards!</li>
      <li>Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during your project.</li>

      <li>A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project</li>
      <li>A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.</li>
